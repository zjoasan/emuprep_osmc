# emuprep_osmc
This is a script to prepare OSMC v.19(Bullseye), to be able to run some emulators. 

This first daft is focused on Vero4k to begin with, I feel obligated to say there is some "guessed/calculated risk" automation, if you have any usb-drives automounted with a label begining with "H/h" and/or have a folder begining with "Z/z" in osmc homefolder, I recommend you read the script and try to manualy do what is "automated".

I will try to write some fault handling for H and Z into the script but right now I just want some user feedback.

The next step is, should we have a guide for installing emulators, Like an interactive questioner
